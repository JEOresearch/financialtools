# financialtools
This repository is a collection of code for tasks such as stock analysis, cash management, and other financial support.

Each folder in this repsitory will eventually contain a number of different useful tools for analysis. These are all open source! All I ask is that if these tools end up benefiting you in some way, please carve out a small portion of your time to help others in any way you can.

Best,
Dr. O
