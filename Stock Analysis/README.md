TrendPlotter.py is a python program that takes in a csv file with stock data and plots the data with long term trend lines representing a best, worst, and average case scenario. The average case is adjustable by clicking. The purpose is to help investors determine whether a stock or index has deviated from a long term trend.

A sample csv file of the S&P 500 index data is included for reference, which was downloaded from Yahoo finance. 

Note that a significant portion of this code was generated using ChatGPT.
